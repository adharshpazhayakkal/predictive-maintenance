Predictive Maintenance Using Decision Trees
Overview
This project focuses on predictive maintenance, a data-driven approach to anticipate machine failures and schedule maintenance activities proactively. By leveraging decision trees and advanced validation techniques, we aim to develop a robust predictive model to enhance maintenance strategies and reduce unexpected downtimes.

Importance of Predictive Maintenance
Predictive maintenance is vital for several reasons:

Reduces Downtime: Predicting failures allows for timely interventions, minimizing unplanned downtime.
Cost Savings: Preventative measures are generally less expensive than reactive repairs, leading to significant cost savings.
Improves Safety: Early detection of potential failures can prevent accidents and enhance workplace safety.
Increases Efficiency: Well-maintained equipment operates more efficiently, boosting overall productivity.
Extends Equipment Life: Regularly addressing potential issues prolongs the lifespan of machinery, ensuring better return on investment.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project provides comprehensive information on various machines and their operating conditions. It includes the following features:

UDI: Unique Device Identifier - a unique identifier for each device or unit in the dataset.
Product ID: Identifier for the type or model of the product being monitored.
Type: Type of product or machine being monitored (e.g., motor, compressor).
Air temperature [K]: The temperature of the air surrounding the machine in Kelvin.
Process temperature [K]: The temperature of the machine's internal process in Kelvin.
Rotational speed [rpm]: The speed at which the machine rotates, measured in revolutions per minute (rpm).
Torque [Nm]: The torque exerted by the machine, measured in Newton-meters (Nm).
Tool wear [min]: The cumulative amount of time the machine's tool has been in use, measured in minutes.
Target: The target variable indicating whether a failure occurred or not.
Failure Type: Type of failure that occurred, if any, categorized based on the failure mode.
The dataset consists of 10,000 entries, with 348 indicating a failure and 9,652 as operational.

Methodology
Decision Tree
A decision tree is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, resulting in a tree-like model of decisions. In this project, we utilize decision trees to predict machine failures.

10-Fold Cross-Validation
10-fold cross-validation is a robust technique for assessing the performance of a predictive model. The dataset is divided into 10 equal parts, and the model is trained and validated 10 times, each time using a different part as the validation set and the remaining parts as the training set. This approach ensures that every data point is used for validation exactly once, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

Cost Complexity Pruning
Cost complexity pruning is a method to improve the generalization of decision trees by reducing their size. It involves cutting back the tree by removing nodes that provide little predictive power, thereby balancing the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. This technique helps in preventing overfitting and enhances the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model using decision trees that can accurately predict potential machine failures. The model will be validated using 10-fold cross-validation and optimized with cost complexity pruning to ensure robust and reliable predictions.

Conclusion
Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to managing machinery and equipment, ensuring their optimal performance and longevity. By leveraging decision trees and advanced validation techniques, this project aims to develop a reliable predictive model to enhance maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and achieve cost savings.
